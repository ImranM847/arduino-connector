# Arduino Connector

arduino-connect allows your board to connect to the arduino-cloud and push and receive message through mqtt

## Install

You can follow the [create getting-started](https://create.arduino.cc/getting-started) to create a device and install the connector onto a board.

### From source

If you want to build the connector from source make sure you have the [go toolchain](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed and this repository cloned in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/arduino/arduino-connector.

```bash
$ go get 		# retrieves all the dependencies
$ go build 		# generates the arduino-connector executable
```
